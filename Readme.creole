=== Installation ===
    # The easiest way to install SublimeGDB is via the excellent Package Control Plugin
    ## See http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation
    ### Once package control has been installed, bring up the command palette (cmd+shift+P or ctrl+shift+P)
    ### Type Install and select "Package Control: Install Package"
    ### Select SublimeGDB from the list. Package Control will keep it automatically updated for you
    ## If you don't want to use package control, you can manually install it
    ### Go to your packages directory and type:
    ####        git clone https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeGDB SublimeGDB
    # Back in the editor, open up the command palette by pressing cmd+shift+P or ctrl+shift+P
    # Type SublimeGDB and open up the settings file you want to modify

=== Usage ===

See [[https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeGDB/blob/master/Default.sublime-keymap|the default key bindings]] and [[https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeGDB/blob/master/Default.sublime-mousemap|the default mouse map]].

In short:
* Open up the default settings via the command palette and begin typing GDB and select the default.
* See what options are available, and open up the User SublimeGDB preferences to tweak any values
* If you have multiple projects, you most likely want to put project specific setting in your project file, with a prefixed "sublimegdb_". See the comments at the top of the default SublimeGDB preferences for an example.
* Once you're all configured, you can toggle breakpoints with F9 (OSX Users might want to change the key binding, or disable the "Expos√© and Spaces" key bindings in the System Preferences)
* Launch with F5
* Step over with F10
* Step into with F11
* Step out with Shift+F11
* Click on the appropriate line in the GDB Callstack view to go to that stack frame
* Click a variable in the GDB Variables view to show its children (if available)
* Double click a variable in the GDB Variables view to modify its value
* You can also access some commands by right clicking in any view
